        <li>1 red bell pepper, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>Sliced green onions, for garnish (optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Rinse the rice: </strong></li>
        <P>Place the rice in a fine-mesh sieve and rinse it under cold water until the water runs clear. 
        <P>This helps remove excess starch and ensures fluffy grains.

        <li><strong>Sauté the aromatics: </strong></li>
        <P>Heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. </P>
        <P>Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and diced red bell pepper. 
        <p>Sauté until the onion becomes translucent and the vegetables soften, approximately 5 minutes.</P>

        <li><strong>Add the spices: </strong></li>
        <P>Sprinkle the ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (if desired) over the sautéed vegetables. </P>
        <P>Stir well to coat the vegetables evenly with the aromatic spices. Allow the spices to toast for a minute to release their flavors.</P>

        <li><strong>Cook the rice: </strong></li>
        <P>Add the rinsed rice to the saucepan, stirring it with the spiced vegetables to coat the grains. </P>
        <P>Pour in the vegetable broth and add salt to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, </P>
        <p>cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid.</P>

        <li><strong>Fluff and garnish: </strong></li>
        <P>Once the rice is cooked, remove the saucepan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes. </P>
        <P>Then, use a fork to fluff the rice gently, separating the grains. </P>
        <P>If desired, garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and sliced green onions for added freshness and visual appeal.</P>

        <li><strong> and enjoy: </strong></li>
        <P>Transfer the Red Rice to a serving dish and accompany it with lemon wedges on the side. </P>
        <P>The bright citrusy notes of the lemon can be squeezed over the rice before eating, adding a refreshing tang. </P>
        <P>This vibrant and flavorful Red Rice is a delightful side dish that pairs well with a variety of main courses or can be enjoyed on its own.</P>
