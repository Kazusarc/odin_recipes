            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley leaves, chopped, for garnish (optional)</li>
            <li>Crusty bread, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the chicken: </strong></li>
            <p>Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. 
            Season the chicken generously with salt and black pepper.</p>

            <li><strong>Cook the chicken: </strong></li>
            <p>In a large stockpot, bring the chicken broth to a simmer over medium heat. 
            Add the seasoned chicken pieces to the pot and let them cook for about 30 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked and tender. 
            Skim off any foam that rises to the surface.</p>

            <li><strong>Remove the chicken: </strong></li>
            <p>Use tongs or a slotted spoon to carefully remove the cooked chicken pieces from the broth. 
            Set them aside to cool slightly.</p>

            <li><strong>Add the vegetables and seasonings: </strong></li>
            <p>To the simmering broth, add the chopped onion, sliced carrots, sliced celery, minced garlic, bay leaf, and dried thyme. 
            Season with additional salt and black pepper to taste. Let the vegetables cook in the broth for about 15-20 minutes until they are tender.</p>

            <li><strong>Shred the chicken: </strong></li>
            <p>While the vegetables are cooking, shred the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding the bones and skin.</p>

            <li><strong>Combine the chicken and vegetables: </strong></li>
            <p>Once the vegetables are tender, add the shredded chicken back into the pot. 
            Stir well to combine all the ingredients. Let the soup simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p>

            <li><strong>Serve and garnish: </strong></li>
            <p>Ladle the Homemade Chicken Soup into bowls. If desired, garnish each bowl with freshly chopped parsley for a burst of freshness. 
            Serve the soup hot with crusty bread on the side for a complete and satisfying meal.</p>
